## Running Heroku Instance

Before running make sure you have set up a twitter [api access token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens). Then create a file named `twitter_api.json`. You'll notice that there is a file [twitter_api.template.json](./twitter_api.template.json) and that is the format that should be in the file you've created. Copy the api key in the `key` field and the api key secret in the `secret` field for the program to be able to pull from twitter.
